QUESTION 1. 
* Arithemetic Operators Symbols
Addition = +
Subtraction = -
Multiplication = *
Division = /
Modulus = %
Exponentiation = **
Decreament = --
Increment = ++

* Assignment Operators Symbols:
Arithmetic Assignment Operator: += -= *= /= %= **=
Logical Assignment Operators: &&= ||= ??=
Bitwise Assignment Operators: &= ^= |=
Shift Assignment Operators: <<= >>= >>>=

* Comparison Operators Symbols:
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equal to
=== equal value and equal type (strict equal to)
!= not equal
!== not equal value or not equal type (strict not equal to)

* Logical Operators Symbols:
&& and
|| or
! not

Bitwise Operators:
& AND
| OR
^ XOR
~ NOT
<< Zero fill left shift
>> Signed right shift
>>> Zero fill right shift


QUESTION 2
 Examples of JavaScript Operators:
Arithmetic Operators:
10 / 2; output 5.
13 % 2; output 1.

Assignment Operators:
age = 15; variable age is assigned the value 15.
age *= 2; output 30 as age is assigned the value 15 above.
Comparison Operators:
2 <= 8; output true.
10 > 20; output false.
Logical Operators:
10 >= 9 && 4 === 4; output true.
"3" === 3 || 20 <= 15; output false.
Bitwise Operators:
8 << 1; output 16.
4 >> 1; output 2.

QUESTION 4
 CODE:
for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7) {
    console.log(i);
}

OUTPUT:
1
8
15
